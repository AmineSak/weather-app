# Weather Globe Project

## Overview

The AI Globe project is a web application built using **Next.js**, a popular React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation. This application provides an interactive globe interface that displays real-time weather data based on user-selected locations. Users can click on the globe to retrieve weather information for specific coordinates, making it an engaging way to visualize weather patterns around the world. And also use an AI model in order to generate 5 facts about the selected country.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Globe**: Users can click on different locations on the globe to fetch and display weather data.
- **Real-time Weather Data**: The application retrieves current weather information from the Weatherstack API based on the selected coordinates.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a good user experience on various devices.
- **Fact Generation**: Users can generate interesting facts about the selected country using the OpenRouter API, enhancing the educational aspect of the application.

### APIs Used

- **Weatherstack API**: This API is used to fetch real-time weather data based on latitude and longitude coordinates. It provides information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and visibility.
- **OpenRouter API**: This API is utilized to generate facts about the selected country, providing users with additional context and information related to their chosen location.

### Project Structure

The project consists of several key files and directories:

- **`app/`**: Contains the main application code, including pages and components.

  - **`layout.tsx`**: Defines the root layout of the application, including metadata and global styles.
  - **`page.tsx`**: The main page of the application that renders the interactive globe component.
  - **`api/weather/route.js`**: An API route that handles requests for weather data based on latitude and longitude.
  - **`components/GlobeWeather.js`**: The component that renders the globe and handles user interactions to fetch weather data.

- **`public/`**: (Not shown in the snippets) Typically contains static assets like images and icons.

- **`styles/`**: Contains global styles defined in `globals.css`, which uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

- **`next.config.ts`**: Configuration file for Next.js.

- **`package.json`**: Lists project dependencies and scripts for running the application.

- **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration file.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Framework for building server-rendered React applications.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Weatherstack API**: External API used to fetch weather data.
- **OpenRouter API**: AI API used to generate facts about countries.

## Getting Started

To run the Weather Globe project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have **Node.js** (version 14 or later) installed on your machine.
- You will also need **npm** (Node Package Manager), which comes with Node.js.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the project repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmineSak/weather-app.git
   cd weather-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Development Server**:
   In the terminal, run the following command to start the Next.js development server:
